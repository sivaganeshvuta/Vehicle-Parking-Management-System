# Vehicle-Parking-Management-System

A parking management system is used for managing the parking spaces for vehicles in parking lots. A parking management system is the one that allows easier management of vehicles in parking lots. But since then, the number of vehicle owners has incremented.
There are mainly two roles involved in the scene: the visitor, who is driving the vehicle and the parking official, who manages the parking lot.

Thus, an parking lot management system makes the job of both the vehicle parkers and the parking management officials easier.
